<h1>Hangman Game</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This one of my first ever python projects. Its a simple guessing game

<br />


<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Python</b> 

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Kali linux</b> 

<h2>Code walk-through:</h2>

<p>
  This script replicates the hangman game, by randomly selecting a word from a predifined list of words and then prompting the player to guess individual letters. The player has 5 attempts to guess the word correctly before the game ends.  Correct guesses replace underscores with the corresponding letter, while incorrect guesses are counted. The game will end when the player either guesses the entire word or exceeds the number of allowed incorrect guesses.
