Portscanner.py will will perform scan either using tcp or udp scans

1) install python-nmap by using the command "sudo pip install python-nmap" 
make sure you use sudo otherwise, the code I wrote won't recognise that nmap was installed


2) the code I invented will run from port 1 to 200, if you want to change the port range then edit the file and change the range values in line 18 and line 24

3) then the next command is "sudo python3 Portscanner.py"
