<h1>Physical configuration of a network using routers and cisco switches</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
After a series of regular meetings, planning, and troubleshooting, me and my team successfully configured a full physical network using switches and routers. <br>  <br>  We performed subnetting and set up VLANs, Ethernet channels, static routes, SSH configuration, and router-on-a-stick to allow communication between different VLANs.  <br> We also implemented layer 2 security measures such as port security to prevent MAC address flooding. Additionally, we disabled auto-trunking on trunk links to require manual configuration, preventing VLAN hopping and double tagging attacks. Finally, we disabled CDP to mitigate its potential exploitation by malicious individuals.

I'm glad to have worked with this amazing team:
