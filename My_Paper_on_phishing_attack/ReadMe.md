<p>
  Is cyber hygiene a factor that affects the ability of people in their 60s to detect a phishing email? 
This paper explores the prevalence and impact of phishing attacks, especially on individuals aged 60 and above. It discusses 
the evolution of phishing emails, their creation stages, and the role of cyber hygiene in protecting against such attacks. The 
main objective of the paper is to find out if cyber hygiene has an impact on older people's ability to distinguish a genuine or 
phishing email. A Microsoft Survey, consisting of two parts, assesses participants' cyber hygiene and phishing detection 
abilities which is then analyzed using Chi-square. No significant relationship has been found but the paper found key areas 
that need to be improved to improve cyber hygiene levels in older people.
