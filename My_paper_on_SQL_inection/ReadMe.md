<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
This paper explores the vulnerabilities of web 
applications to SQL injection attacks. Furthermore, it will 
discuss the importance of protecting SQL databases, types of 
SQL injection, prevention strategies, and a demonstration that 
shows how to set up a simple login page on Windows and Linux 
servers by using Apache. After full setup, there will be an SQL 
injection attack demonstration and a discussion of possible 
countermeasures.
