<h1>Random Password Generator</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
Unfortunately passwords such as "Password123", "QWERTY" etc are still popular passwords used by users. For these reasons i created a Password Generator to ensure that secure passwords are used all the time

<br />


<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Python</b> 

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Kali linux</b> 

<h2>Code walk-through:</h2>

<p>
  My Python script generates a secure, randomized password based on the user's desired length. The user inputs their preferred password length and the script will combine a series of digits, punctuations,lowercase and uppercase letters to create a strong password.
</p>

<h2>How to run my code:</h2>
<p>
To use this code type sudo python 3 passwordgenerator.py and you will be prompted to type how long you want your password to be. Once selected, your random password will be generated <br>
